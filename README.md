# Parallel 4i Imaging Registration

A collection of scripts designed to perform registration on a large amount of image data in parallel on a HPC cluster.

## Overview

The underlying registration is performed using [Fast4DReg](https://github.com/guijacquemet/Fast4DReg), so consult this repo for information on the registration process. A utility script (`fiji_stack_building.sh`) is included to assemble image stacks for easy input into Fast4DReg.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Building image stacks

The `fiji_stack_building.sh` script is designed to assemble single plane images into a stacks for input into Fast4DReg. We wrote this script to process images output from [Iterative Indirect Immunofluorescence Imaging (4i)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar7042), but it could be easily adapted to process images from other sources.

For processing 4i imaging data, it is assumed the raw images are saved in a folder structure as follows:
```
parent 4i directory
|
|-- Staining Round 1
|   |   metadata.xml
|   |-- data
|       |
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_1.tif
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_2.tif
|       ⋮
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_n.tif
|-- Staining Round 2
|   |   metadata.xml
|   |-- data
|       |
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_1.tif
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_2.tif
|       ⋮
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_n.tif
⋮
⋮
|-- Staining Round M
|   |   metadata.xml
|   |-- data
|       |
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_1.tif
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_2.tif
|       ⋮
|       |   Day#_BMP--W#####--P#####--Z#####--T#####--Channel_n.tif
```
To process such data, `fiji_stack_building.sh` needs to updated as follows and then submitted to a SLURM job scheduler:

* Line 11 needs to be edited to point to the parent directory as illustrated above:
  ```shell
  parentDir=(<path to parent 4i directory>)
  ```
* Line 6 needs to be updated with the number of tif files in one of the data directories. It is assumed the the number of files in each data directory is the same - if this is not the case, empty images will be placed in the output stacks were missing files were encountered:
  ```shell
  #SBATCH --array=0-<number of tif files in one of the data directories>
  ```
* Line 13 needs to updated with the path to your output directory where the assembled stacks will be saved:
  ```shell
  outputDir=(<path to output directory>)
  ```
* Line 15 needs to updated with the path to your FIJI installation:
  ```shell
  fijiDir=(<path to fiji installation>)
  ```
If everything runs successfully, then you should see TIF stacks appearing in your output directory.

### Step 2: Estimate XY-misalignment using reference channel

Run `estimate_correction.sh` to estimate the misalignment in a reference channel (usually DAPI). This will require updating...
* line 11 to point to the output directory from Step 1:
  ```shell
  inputDir=(<path to output directory from Step 1>)
  ```
* line 6 to include the number of reference stacks:
  ```shell
  #SBATCH --array=0-<number of reference stacks>
  ```
* line 13 to point to your FIJI installation:
  ```shell
  fijiDir=(<path to fiji installation>)
  ```
* (Optional) line 15 if your reference stacks contain something other than 'DAPI' in their filenames:
  ```shell
  files=("$inputDir"/*DAPI*.tif)
  ```

If this step runs successfully, you should see folders of results appearing in your output directory from Step 1, including settings files and aligned stacks (for the reference channel).

### Step 3: Align all stacks using outputs from Step 2

Run `apply_correction.sh` to register all stacks. This will require updating...
* line 11 to point to the output directory from Step 1:
  ```shell
  inputDir=(<path to output directory from Step 1>)
  ```
* line 6 to include the number of tif files in the output directory from Step 1:
  ```shell
  #SBATCH --array=0-<number of tif stacks compiled in Step 1>
  ```
* line 13 to point to your FIJI installation:
  ```shell
  fijiDir=(<path to fiji installation>)
  ```
* Line 15 to point to your output directory where the alligned stacks will be saved:
  ```shell
  outputDir=(<path to output directory>)
  ```

If this step runs successfully, you should see TIF stacks appearing in the specified output directory.
